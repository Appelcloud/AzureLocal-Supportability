# Symptoms
When trying to Arc Register the new node, user sees the following error message:

# Error: 
Bootstrap reported error: A ArcAgentConnectionException error occurred with the message: 'AZCMAgent command failed with error:  >> exitcode: 42. Additional Info: See https://aka.ms/arc/azcmerror'

# Issue Validation
Run this cmdlet on each node to see what powershell module versions are present
`Get-InstalledModule Az.Accounts`

If 5.0.0 version is seen, this is expected because of a breaking change -

Version    Name                                Repository           Description
-------    ----                                ----------           -----------
5.0.0      Az.Accounts                         PSGallery            Microsoft Azure PowerShell - Accounts credential...

Release until 2505 expects Az.Accounts version to be 4.0.2, any higher version is not supported.

If there are any versions besides expected version, they need to be removed.
