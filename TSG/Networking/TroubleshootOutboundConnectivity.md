# Troubleshoot Azure Local outbound network connectivity

## Overview

Azure Local requires outbound / egress network connectivity from the management network of your Azure Local instances to a list of public endpoints. Network connectivity to these endpoints is required for Azure Local to use Azure as a reliable management and control plane, such as for initial deployment, updates and workload provisioning operational capabilities. Allowing connectivity to the list of endpoints is a prerequisite for deployment, but ongoing connectivity to the list of endpoints is vital for support, manageability and licensing compliance.

For additional information on Azure Local Firewall requirements, please review - [Azure Local Firewall documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-local/concepts/firewall-requirements)

## Symptoms

Integrating Azure Local into your existing Firewall and/or Proxy Server infrastructure can be challenging depending on your organization's network security policies, such as requirements to define a strict access control list of the URL endpoints that are allowed to communicate from your Azure Local instance(s) "management network" to the required endpoints.

There are several symptoms or issues that will occur if the required endpoints are not accessible from your Azure Local instance(s), below are just a few examples:

1. Azure Local instance cloud deployment and/or update operations fail with network failure or timeout.
1. Physical machines show their "Azure Arc" status as "Disconnected" in Azure portal experience (_Arc agent not connected_).
1. Deployment of new Azure Local VMs fails with RPC failure in Azure portal as the ARM deployment status.
1. Updates fail at "update ARB and extensions" step  with "SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED" shown in Azure portal update blade.
1. There are many other network related issues that could occur when the required endpoints are not accessible from the management (_physical machines and ARB_) network address space.

Azure Local includes built-in automation modules that are executed as part of Solution Update Readiness and Environment Checker modules, both of these modules include connectivity tests that validate network connectivity status to critical endpoints. The output of these can be viewed locally using PowerShell, or using Azure portal during updates.

> Note: For examples of how to use and view the output of Azure Local "Solution Update Environment" and "Environment Checker" built-in modules, see the [Appendix section](#appendix) at the bottom of this article.

## Additional diagnostic and support tools

To provide further assistance for support, validation, testing or support request (SR) troubleshooting scenarios, a stand-alone PowerShell function called **Test-AzureLocalConnectivity** has been created and  published in the PowerShell Gallery. This tool can be used to validate connectivity to the required endpoints, the function generates output to the console and to a comma separate value (CSV) file on the node, that can be easily viewed in Excel, once copied from the node, and/or shared as a point in time status of the connectivity tests.

## Issue Validation

If you are experiencing network related issues or failures, as per the examples described in 'Symptoms' section, you can follow the steps in the 'Mitigation Details' below to gain further insights and diagnostic data to validate the required endpoints are accessible from your on-premises network, using any firewall and/or proxy server network infrastructure you or your network provider has configured.

## Mitigation Details

To help with troubleshooting or root causing network connectivity issues, you can use the **Test-AzureLocalConnectivity** function which is included in the **AzStackHCI.DiagnosticSettings** module, to automate testing connectivity is working correctly from your Azure Local physical machines to the required public endpoints. The function supports Arc Gateway scenarios and has an "-AzureRegion" parameter to allow you to test against a specific Azure region that matches your Azure Local instance deployment.

The 'Test-AzureLocalConnectivity' function has a dependency on the Azure Local Environment Checker module being installed, which is installed by default on all Azure Local physical machines. If Environment Checker module (_AzStackHci.EnvironmentChecker_) is not installed on the device running the connectivity test, you will be prompted to install the module first. The device used to install the AzStackHCI.DiagnosticSettings module and test connectivity must have access to the PowerShell Gallery, in order to download the module (_nuget package_) to install it.

**To install the AzStackHCI.DiagnosticSettings** module to enable you to perform connectivity tests for a support or troubleshooting scenario, you can use the commands below:

```Powershell
# Install the AzStackHCI.DiagnosticSettings module, this can be on an Azure Local physical machine (recommended), or any device inside your network (if it is using the same firewall / proxy configuration as your Azure Local instance).
Install-Module -Name "AzStackHci.DiagnosticSettings" -Repository PSGallery

# Test Azure Local Connectivity for a specific target Azure region.
# /// ACTION: Update <AzureRegionName> and <YourKeyVaultName> to match the values of your Azure Region and Key Vault.
Test-AzureLocalConnectivity -AzureRegion "<AzureRegionName>" -KeyVaultURL "https://<YourKeyVaultName>.vault.azure.net"

```

For the most recent / up to date list of supported Azure regions review the ["Azure requirements" - System requirements for Azure Local](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-local/concepts/system-requirements-23h2?view=azloc-24113#azure-requirements) article. At the time of publishing this article, the list of valid Azure Region names for Azure Local include:

* "EastUS", "WestEurope", "AustraliaEast", "CanadaCentral", "CentralIndia", "JapanEast", "SouthCentral", "SouthEastAsia"

If you would like to test an individual public endpoints using PowerShell for troubleshooting or support purposes, you can use the "Test-Layer7Connectivity" function using the commands below:

```Powershell

# Install the "AzStackHci.DiagnosticSettings" module

Install-Module -Name "AzStackHci.DiagnosticSettings" -Repository PSGallery

# To test an individual endpoint (after installing the module), with Verbose and Debug output, use the "Test-Layer7Connectivity" function, as shown below:
$url = 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/'
Test-Layer7Connectivity -url $url -port 443 -Verbose -Debug

```

### Example output

Example output is shown in the animated GIF image below, which shows an interactive console demo.

The primary source of information is copying / exporting the CSV file that is generated from the node to your laptop or desktop PC to open the output in Excel, or another CSV file viewer.

## Appendix

### Environment Checker Connectivity Tests

To view the output from Azure Local **Environment Checker** Connectivity Validation tests, use the PowerShell command below:

````PowerShell
Invoke-AzStackHciConnectivityValidation -PassThru | Where-Object -Property Status -eq FAILURE | Sort-Object TargetResourceName | Format-Table TargetResourceName -Autosize
````

For additional information for how to use Azure Local Environment Checker module, refer to this article: [Readiness of your environment for Azure Local - "Run readiness checks" section](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-local/manage/use-environment-checker?view=azloc-24113&tabs=connectivity#run-readiness-checks).

### Solution Update Environment Tests

To view the output from **all tests** included Azure Local **Solution Update Readiness**, which includes connectivity validation and tests for critical public endpoints, use the PowerShell command below:

````PowerShell
# Check Solution Update Environment
$Result = Get-SolutionUpdateEnvironment

# View "not equal to SUCCESS" alerts
$Result.HealthCheckResult | Where-Object {$_.Status -ne "SUCCESS"} | Format-List Title, Status, Severity, Description, Remediation

# Output to Text format
$Result.HealthCheckResult | Out-File "C:\Temp\HealthResult-$((Get-Cluster).Name)).txt"

# Output to JSON format
$Result.HealthCheckResult | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Out-File "C:\Temp\HealthResult-$((Get-Cluster).Name)).json"

````

For additional information for how to analyze and understand the **$Results.HealthCheckResult** array, refer to this article: [Solution Update Readiness Checker - "using PowerShell" section](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/azure-local/update/update-troubleshooting-23h2?view=azloc-24113#using-powershell).
