# Security vulnerability for Arc VMs running on Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2

## Description

Microsoft has identified a security vulnerability that could expose the local admin credentials used during the creation of Arc VMs on Azure Stack HCI to non-admin users on the VM and on the hosts.  

## Affected releases

Arc VMs created on releases prior to Azure Stack HCI 2411 release are vulnerable.

## Mitigation and ongoing protection

To mitigate this risk, we recommend that you take 2 actions:
 
- Update Azure Stack HCI resources to version 2411. See the instructions on how to [Update](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure-stack/hci/update/about-updates-23h2#user-interfaces-for-updates).
- Rotate the administrator passwords (set during VM creation) for all Azure Arc VMs deployed prior to updating the Azure Stack HCI instance to version 2411. See the instructions on how to update these passwords:
    - [Identify Arc VMs](#identify-arc-vms)
    - [Change local account passwords](#change-local-account-passwords)


### Identify Arc VMs

1. Run the following script to identify all the Arc VMs created before the Azure Stack HCI 2411 release. Make sure to change the variables in the beginning of the script with the appropriate values and run it in Administrative context.


```powershell

# Install necessary modules and set execution policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
Import-Module -Name Az.Resources

# Variables
$resourceGroup="Name of your resource group”
$clusterName="Name of the cluster"
$tenantID="GUID of the Azure Tenant"
$subscriptionID="GUID of the Azure Subscription"

# Login to the Azure Tenant
az login --tenant $tenantID
Connect-AzAccount -Tenant $tenantID -Subscription $subscriptionID

# Get the update date of the cluster 
$install_date=Get-AzResource -ResourceId "/subscriptions/$subscriptionID/resourceGroups/$resourceGroup/providers/microsoft.azurestackhci/clusters/$clusterName/updates/Solution10.2411.0.22" -ExpandProperties

# Get the list of VMs and their creation dates
az config set extension.dynamic_install_allow_preview=true
$vms=az stack-hci-vm list --resource-group $resourceGroup | ConvertFrom-json

# Format the table and flag VMs that are updated before the update date
$results = @()
foreach($vm in $vms) {
   $condition = [datetime]$vm.properties.systemData.createdAt le $install_date.properties.installedDate
   $results += [PSCustomObject]@{
       VMName                      = $vm.Name
       CreationDate                = [datetime]$vm.properties.systemData.createdAt
       ClusterUpdateDate           = $install_date.properties.installedDate
       CredentialUpdateRequired    = $condition
   }
}
$results | Format-Table -AutoSize
        
```

### Change local account passwords

Arc VM creation generates two local administrator accounts:

- Local administrator account 1

    - Name: administrator (automatically created name)
    - Password: Randomly generated password

- Local administrator account 2

    - Name: User provided name
    - Password: User provided password


> [!NOTE] We recommend changing the passwords for both local administrator accounts.

Once the Arc VMs are identified, follow these steps to change the local account passwords.
    
The steps are different for Windows and Linux VMs.

#### Windows VMs

For Windows VMs, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Arc VM.
2. Run the following PowerShell script. This script will help you change the passwords for both the accounts.

    Make sure to change the `$username` variable with the account name provided during Arc VM creation.

    ```powershell
    # Define the username
    $username = "AccountName"
    
    # Prompt the user to enter the new password securely
    $newPassword = Read-Host -AsSecureString "Enter the new password for $username"
    
    # Prompt the user to re-enter the new password securely for verification
    $verifyPassword = Read-Host -AsSecureString "Re-enter the new password for verification"
    
    # Convert the secure strings to plain text for comparison
    $plainPassword = [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto([Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($newPassword))
    $plainVerifyPassword = [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto([Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($verifyPassword))
    
    # Check if the passwords match and change the password if they match. Fail if the passwords don’t match.
    if ($plainPassword -ceq $plainVerifyPassword) {
       $account = [ADSI]"WinNT://./$username,user"
       $account.SetPassword($plainPassword)
       $account.SetInfo()
     
       $account = [ADSI]"WinNT://./administrator,user"
       $account.SetPassword($plainPassword)
       $account.SetInfo()
    
        Write-Host "Password for user $username has been reset successfully." -ForegroundColor Green
    } else {
        Write-Host "The passwords do not match. Please try again." -ForegroundColor Red
    }    
    ```

#### Linux VMs

For Linux VMs, follow these steps:



1. Sign in to the Arc VM.
2. Run the following script from where Bash is installed:

    If Bash is located in a different directory, make sure to change this line `#!/bin/bash` accordingly.

    ```Bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    # Define the username
    username="AccountName"
    
    # Prompt the user to enter the new password securely
    echo -n "Enter the new password for $username: "
    read -s newPassword
    echo
    
    # Prompt the user to re-enter the new password securely for verification
    echo -n "Re-enter the new password for verification: "
    read -s verifyPassword
    echo
    
    # Check if the passwords match
    if [ "$newPassword" == "$verifyPassword" ]; then
        # Reset the password for the local account
        echo "$username:$newPassword" | sudo chpasswd
        echo -e "\e[32mPassword for user $username has been reset successfully.\e[0m"
    else
        echo -e "\e[31mThe passwords do not match. Please try again.\e[0m"
    fi
    ```
