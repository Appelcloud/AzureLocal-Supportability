# Overview

# Start-AzsSupportStorageDiagnostic
This cmdlet performs an automated analysis of the Storage Spaces Direct feature in Azure Local. It provides results and recommendations for next steps, along with in-depth troubleshooting tools to help identify the root cause of any issues detected.

## Diagnostic Health Checks

The following checks can be run either all at once by default or initiated individually using the `-Include` switch in `Start-AzsSupportStorageDiagnostic`. Each test is detailed below with the corresponding argument for `-Include`.

Example:

### MissingDisks

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
|Missing Disks from Storage Spaces | Compares physical disks in non-primordial Storage Pool count against disks detected via Plug and Play (PnP) which are eligible to add to pool.

### StorageHealth

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Storage Pool Health Check | Checks for any Storage Pool that is not in a healthy state, which is determined by anything other than Health Status of OK.
| Cluster Nodes Health Process Running | Ensures that all Nodes in Cluster are running the Health Service process (Healthpih.exe).
| Storage Job Check | Looks for any Storage Jobs that are running on the system, in a healthy system the expectation is that there will be no jobs running on the system.
| Cluster Node Check | Gets any Cluster Nodes that are in any other state than “Up”, which would indicate a requirement to review.
| Cluster Shared Volumes Check | Confirms that no Cluster Shared Volumes are present that have a state that is not “Online”.
| Storage Enclosure Check | Checks storage enclosures that have a health status that is not healthy.
| Health Service Fault Check | Checks Health Service faults any active issues detected.
| Storage Health Action Check | Health Service actions that have a state other than succeeded, implying that the automated action has failed.
| Disks Not in Pool Check | Checks if any physical disks in Storage Spaces are not present in the non-primordial pool.

### VirtualDisks

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Virtual Disk Check | Confirms if any Virtual Disks are in a Health Status other than that of Healthy.

### DirtyCount

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
Dirty Count | Checks if the Dirty Region Tracking (DRT) has been exceeded for the disk, as the volume will stay offline until cleared.

### StorageComponents
| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Support Components Change | Checks if the Supported Components Document has been specified and if current results `Get-PhysicalDisk` are not supported by this configuration currently and suggests new configuration if valid to avoid quarantine.
| Support Components Missing | Shows if detected the Physical disks and running firmware in storage spaces are not present in Supported Components Document.

### SNV (Storage Node View)
| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Storage Node View Differs | Checks if Storage Node View differs between Nodes for Physical Disks where Health Status not in a healthy state or Operation Status other than OK.

### FirmwareDrift
| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Firmware Drift | Reviews if there are models of physical disk with different versions of firmware running.

### SMPHost
| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Cluster Nodes SMPHost Running | Confirms if the Storage Management Provider host service is running on all Cluster Nodes.

### SMPHostIssue
| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| SMPHost Issue Detected | Checks if Virtual Disks are displaying detached but Cluster Shared Volume shows online.

### DiskHealth
This provides a table view of all disks configured with key information along with the below:

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Storage Spaces Partitions Check | Checks if Storage Spaces partitions for chosen disk usage are correctly created.
| Disk Health Check | Checks all Physical disks that are not healthy.
| Transient Disk Check | Checks if any Physical are in a health status of “Transient Error”, as this can be a temporary error or indicative of other issues such as partitions not correctly configured for disk usage.


## Diagnostic Information and Configuration
The following arguments provide storage information and configuration rather than running tests.

| Report | Argument |
|--------|-------------|
| Storage Summary | [StorageSummary](#storagesummary) |
| Cluster Shared Volume Usage | [CSVUsage](#csvusage) |

### StorageSummary

| Configuration Check | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Storage Nodes Configuration | Provides information related to the node, serial number, server name, manufacturer, model and last boot time.
| Volume Configuration | Information related to Volumes created from the storage pool.
| Virtual Disk Configuration | Information related to virtual disks created from storage pool.
| Pool Configuration | Information related to non-primordial pool configuration.
| Storage Spaces Direct Configuration | Information related to Storage Spaces configuration.
| Capacity Details | Information related to capacity, cache and supported components.

### CSVUsage

| Configuration Check | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Cluster Shared Volume Usage | Current space consumption

## Additional Analysis
To diagnose physical extent issues causing unexpected states of Virtual Disks, use the `-PhysicalExtentCheck` parameter and specify the friendly name of the drive. This will attempt to identify the root cause of the disk problem.

Example:
```powershell
Start-AzsSupportStorageDiagnostic -PhysicalExtentCheck 'NAME'
```
