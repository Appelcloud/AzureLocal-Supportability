# Azure Stack HCI Supportability

This repo may be used by insiders to file issues. This will provide a public forum to generate discussion and prevent the same issues from being reported. Insiders can see previous issues and provide additional comments, and the HCI team can provide status updates as we resolve these issues.

## Issue Reporting

To file any issues that you identify, please go to the "Issues" tab and create a "New Issue". Please feel free to contribute to the discussion for any existing issues.
